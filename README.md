InnoGames Data Collectors

This repository is for general-purpose data collector scripts which
produce Graphite compatible output developed by InnoGames.  We have
packages for project specific scripts.  Please don't commit them there.

Style Guide
-----------

The scripts are named with lower-case underscore notation.  They
include the file extension .py.  Not portable ones prefixed by
the operating system they are working on.
